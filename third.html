    <p>	  
	  My journey into the world of mechanics and manufacturing began at the tender age of five, inspired by my father—a Volkswagen mechanic and also my hero. Growing up with a passion for fixing and understanding hot things ticked, My early hands-on experiences set the stage for a career grounded in practical knowledge and relentless curiosity.
      <br /><br />
	  My professional career started in boat manufacturing, where I honed my skills crafting high-quality vessels. From the shop floor, I progressed to repairing tools for the night shift, a role that combined my technical aptitude with problem-solving instincts. This hands-on work laid the foundation for my transition into maintenance—a pivotal move that expanded my responsibilities and became the springboard for my leadership development and project oversight capabilities.
	  <br /><br />
	  My leadership style is rooted in collaboration and mutual respect. As a round-table leader, I value every team member’s input and foster an environment where debate and learning thrive. I believes leadership is about riding alongside your team, sharing both victories and challenges, and never abandoning the people who depend on you.
	  <br /><br />
	  Over the years, I have evolved from a skilled maintenance professional into a hybrid powerhouse—merging my mechanical expertise with emerging technology. Recognizing the shifting industry landscape, I'm actively pivoting towards the tech sector, leveraging my background to bridge the gap between hands-on work and digital innovation.
	  <br /><br />
	  Though I don't come from a traditional educational background, MY intelligence, adaptability, and dedication to continuous learning have propelled me forward. I encourages others with similar roots to embrace new skills and stay relevant in a rapidly changing world.
	  <br /><br />
      Today, I stand as a versatile professional, ready to lead in roles that combine the grit of maintenance with the precision of technology—a true example of adaptability and growth in the modern workforce.
